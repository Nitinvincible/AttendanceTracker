2. Fill in:
   - **Your Name** (admin account)
   - **Company Name** (unique — this is your tenant namespace)
   - **Email** and **Password**
   - **Theme** (Medical / Corporate / Government / Education)
3. Click **Create Account** — you are now the admin of your company

## 2. Dashboard

The **Dashboard** (`/`) gives you an at-a-glance overview of your organization.

### Stat Cards
| Card | What it shows |
|------|--------------|
| Total Members | All enrolled members in your company |
| Present Today | Count marked present for today |
| Absent Today | Count marked absent for today |
| Attendance Rate | `(Present ÷ Total) × 100` for today |

### 7-Day Chart
A bar chart comparing **Present vs Absent** for each of the last 7 days. Hover a bar for exact numbers.

### Recent Attendance Records (bottom)
A full table of all saved attendance records, **grouped by date** (newest first). Each group shows:
- A **date header** with quick present/absent pill counts
- A table of every member with their status (✓ Present / ✗ Absent)

> 💡 If this section is empty, go to **Attendance** and save records first.

## 3. Departments *(Admin only)*

1. Click the **pencil icon** on any row
2. Edit the name inline → press **Enter** or click ✓

### Delete a Department
1. Click the **trash icon** on any row
2. Confirm the prompt
3. Members in that department become unassigned (not deleted)

---

## 4. Members — Manage Employees / Students

Navigate to **Members** from the sidebar.

### View & Search
- All enrolled members are listed in a table
- Use the **search bar** to filter by name, ID, or department in real time

### Add a Member
1. Click **+ Add Member** (top right)
2. Fill in:
   - **Full Name**
   - **ID** (Staff ID / Roll Number — unique within the company)
   - **Department** (select from the dropdown — add departments first!)
3. Click **Add Member**

### Edit a Member ✏️

---

## 5. Mark Attendance

Navigate to **Attendance** from the sidebar.

### Workflow
1. **Select a date** using the date picker — defaults to today
2. Each member appears as a row with a **toggle button**:
   - 🟢 **Present** — green, click to switch to Absent
   - 🔴 **Absent** — red, click to switch to Present
3. Use **All Present** or **All Absent** to set everyone at once
4. Click **Save Attendance**

> Re-submitting attendance for a date **overwrites** the previous records. Use this to correct mistakes.

## 6. Advanced — Employee Accounts *(Admin only)*

Navigate to **Advanced** from the sidebar.

Admins can create **login accounts** for employees so they can access the system.

### Create an Employee Account
1. Click **+ Create Employee Account**
2. Enter the employee's Name, Email, and (optional) Department
3. Click **Create Account** — a **random password is generated and shown once**
4. Copy and share the password with the employee — you **cannot retrieve it later**

### Delete an Employee Account
- Click the **trash icon** on any employee row → confirm

---

## 7. Settings *(Admin only)*

Navigate to **Settings** from the sidebar.

- **Theme** — switch between Medical / Corporate / Government / Education
- **Custom Labels** — override member, ID, and group label text for your organization

---

## 8. Switching Themes

At the **bottom of the Admin section in the sidebar**, you'll find a sector switcher. Clicking a different sector immediately updates colors and labels across the whole app.

---

## 9. Tips & Tricks

- **Set up Departments first** — before adding members, create your departments so the dropdown is populated
- **Employees use company login** — when an employee logs in they must also enter the Company Name
- **History never auto-deletes** — old attendance records remain in the Dashboard records table indefinitely
- **Render cold start** — the free-tier backend may take ~30s to respond after period of inactivity

## 10. Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Department dropdown is empty | Go to **Departments** page and create departments first |
| "Company not found" on login | Make sure the Company Name matches exactly (case-sensitive) |
| Dashboard shows all zeros | No attendance has been saved yet — go to **Attendance** and save records |
| "Roll number already exists" | The ID is already taken by another member in your company |
| Backend not responding (local) | Run `uvicorn main:app --reload` in the `backend/` folder |
| Frontend blank page (local) | Run `npm run dev` in the `frontend/` folder |
| Render API is slow first request | Free tier hibernates — wait ~30s for cold start |
